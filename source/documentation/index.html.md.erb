## Who is this for?

This page is intended for MoJ's engineering teams who are managing the configuration of M365 services, or intending to manage, with M365 desired state configuration integrated into MoJ's DevOps framework

## What is M365DSC?

Microsoft365DSC is an Open-Source initiative lead by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. It allows you to write a definition for how your Microsoft 365 tenant should be configured, automate the deployment of that configuration and ensures the monitoring of the defined configuration, notifying and acting on detected configuration drifts. 

It is the primary tool used by the MoJ to automate the management of the organisations tenants in line with the NCSC & Microsoft [blueprint for UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/microsoft-365-guidance-for-uk-government).

Microsoft365DSC is built as a module for the [PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/overview) framework and is made available via the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft365DSC).
