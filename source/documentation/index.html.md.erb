# M365 Configuration as Code - Technical Guidance 

## Who is this for?

This page is intended for staff who are responsible for the configuration, security and operation of the Ministry of Justice’s Microsoft 365 services. 

It holds information on the Ministry of Justice’s Microsoft 365 DSC DevOps integrated architecture. including detailed guidance, engineering references, and an overview of the intended scope and configuration. The aim is to facilitate the onboarding process and support for administrators managing our tenants.

## What is Microsoft 365 DSC?

Microsoft365DSC is an Open-Source initiative lead by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. It allows you to write a definition for how your Microsoft 365 tenant should be configured, automate the deployment of that configuration and ensures the monitoring of the defined configuration, notifying and acting on detected configuration drifts. 

It is the primary tool used by the MoJ to automate the management of the organisations tenants in line with the NCSC & Microsoft [blueprint for UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/microsoft-365-guidance-for-uk-government).

Microsoft365DSC is built as a module for the [PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/overview) framework and is made available via the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft365DSC).

## Solution Overview 

This solution provides a comprehensive framework for automating the management of Microsoft 365 configurations using Microsoft365DSC and Azure DevOps. It is composed of two Git repositories:

[Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration)

[Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Infrastructure](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Infrastructure)

These repositories work together to enable configuration management, compliance testing, and deployment orchestration for the MoJ’s Microsoft 365 environments.

### Components

* Azure DevOps Pipelines - Azure Pipelines are an Azure DevOps service for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Azure Pipelines are used to test and build your code and ship it to any target. You can also use Azure Pipelines to implement quality gates to help ensure that you deploy changes in a controlled and consistent manner.
* Managed DevOps Pool - Managed DevOps Pools in Azure DevOps provide a fully managed service where virtual machines or containers powering the agent pools used to run the pipelines, offering seamless scalability and management for CI/CD pipelines.
* NAT Gateway - Azure NAT Gateway is a fully managed and highly resilient Network Address Translation (NAT) service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect outbound to the internet while remaining fully private, ensuring secure and scalable outbound connectivity.
* Key Vault - Key Vault improves the security of storage for tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets. It also provides tightly controlled access to the service principles certificates that are used in this solution.
* Storage Account - Azure Storage Accounts provide scalable and secure storage solutions for various data types, including blobs, files, queues, and tables, and are used in this M365 DevOps framework to store and manage modules, ensuring efficient and reliable deployment and configuration of Microsoft 365 environments.
* Microsoft365DSC - provides automation for the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of Microsoft 365 tenants via PowerShell Desired Stage Configuration (DSC). Microsoft365DSC is used to deploy configuration changes to the Microsoft 365 tenants via Azure Pipelines.
* Windows PowerShell DSC - is a management platform in PowerShell. You can use it to manage your development infrastructure by using a configuration-as-code model. This model is the underlying technology that Microsoft365DSC uses.
* GitHub - GitHub is the leading platform used for version control and collaboration of code within the MoJ, enabling developers to manage and share their code, track changes, and collaborate on projects seamlessly.

### Well-Architected Framework Alignment

This section details how our solution aligns with the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework alongside CAF & NCSC guidance, ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient architecture. By adhering to the five core pillars of the framework—Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, and Performance Efficiency—we have designed a solution that meets the standards set out in the framework. Our approach includes implementing stringent security measures to protect data integrity and confidentiality, optimising costs through efficient resource management, and ensuring operational excellence with comprehensive monitoring and automated systems.

#### Reliability

Deploying a Managed DevOps Pool to run our pipelines on significantly enhances reliability. Managed DevOps Pools provide a fully managed service where virtual machines powering the agents rely on Microsofts infrastructure for reliability ensuring that availability and fault tolerance is managed by Microsoft therefore reducing the risk of downtime and improving overall system stability. The managed nature of these pools means that updates, scaling, and maintenance are handled automatically, ensuring consistent performance and minimizing disruption

#### Security 

Using the combination of Managed DevOps Pools, NAT Gateway, and Private Endpoints for Key Vault and Storage Account access significantly enhances the security of our solution, aligning with the Security pillar of the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework. Managed DevOps Pools ensure that the infrastructure is maintained by Microsoft, reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with security best practices. The NAT Gateway provides secure outbound internet connectivity for resources in private subnets with a dedicated public IP address to be used within conditional access on the managed tenants, while preventing unsolicited inbound connections, adhering to the zero trust network security model. Additionally, Private Endpoints for Key Vault and Storage Accounts enable secure, private access to these resources by using private IP addresses within the virtual network, eliminating exposure to the public internet. This setup ensures that sensitive data remains protected and access is tightly controlled.

#### Cost Optimization

Due to the small footprint of resources required for this solution it natively comes with a low total cost of ownership, this has been further supplemented by the auto scaling features of Managed DevOps Pools to ensure there is no requirement for standing disk and compute.

#### Operational Excellence 

Separate GitHub repositories and Azure DevOps projects are used to segregate the management of the tenant configurations from the CICD infrastructure to ensure that access to resources are limited to the teams who are responsible for parts of the service. Furthermore the DSC configuration leverages the use of tenant specific data files combined with shared baseline configurations to promote modularity, reduces redundancy, and improves maintainability. 

The use of the CODEOWNERS file within the configuration repository allows GitHub teams to be set as the owners of specific files to be used within approval workflows to ensure that any changes made to configurations are approved by the technical authority of the product team who are responsible for the given M365 service. 

This approach aligns with industry best practices for managing DSC configurations, ensuring modularity, security, and maintainability. It also supports the Well-Architected Frameworks principles of operational excellence and security by providing a structured and secure approach to configuration management

#### Performance Efficiency

This architecture makes use of a storage account to cache the Microsoft 365 DSC modules and its prerequisites to make them readily available to the agent pool upon each pipeline run. When a new version of Microsoft 365 DSC is specified in the CICD repository, a pipeline will automatically make sure the prerequisites are downloaded, packaged and uploaded to the specified Blob Storage, this improves the performance of each pipeline run by decreasing the agent preparation time therefore improving the performance efficiency of the solution.


### Pipelines 

The Pipelines directory in the Configuration repository contains Azure DevOps pipeline definitions:

* build.yaml: Builds MOF files from configuration data.
* dependencies.yaml: Manages dependencies and secrets for tenants.
* deployment.yaml: Deploys configurations to Microsoft 365 tenants.
* export.yaml: Exports tenant configurations for auditing.
* prvalidation.yaml: Validates pull requests for configuration changes.
* testcompliancy.yaml: Tests tenant compliance with desired configurations.

These pipelines extend templates from the Infrastructure repository to execute the orchestration logic.

### Scripts 

The Scripts directory in the Infrastructure repository contains PowerShell scripts for orchestration:

* Build.ps1: Compiles MOF files from configuration data.
* CheckDscCompliance.ps1: Tests tenant compliance with desired configurations and generates reports.
* Deploy.ps1: Deploys configurations to Microsoft 365 tenants.
* Export.ps1: Exports tenant configurations for auditing.
* SupportFunctions.psm1: Contains helper functions used across scripts.


### Workflow

1. Admin creates a new branch from the `main` Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration repository, with a name relevant to the change they are making e.g. `DEV-TeamsMeetingPolicy-update`
2. Admin makes the required configuration changes to the data files necessary to the change they are making
3. Admin commits and syncs the changes to the feature branch
4. Admin creates a pull request (PR) to merge the changes to the `main` repository, proving a description of what changes have been made to allow others to more efficiently peer review the work
5. The build pipeline runs on the PR
6. Depending on the files that have been changed the relevant lead engineers or architects will be asked to review and approve the change, this is defined based on the content of the `codeowners` file
7. The merged PR triggers a pipeline to compile Managed Object Format (MOF) files. The pipeline calls Azure Key Vault to retrieve the credentials that are used by the tenant specific service principle(s) in the MOF files, and publishes the artifacts ready for deployment
8. The deployment pipeline is triggered that uses the compiled MOF files to deploy configuration changes to the tenants that are managed via Microsoft365DSC
9. Admin who committed the changes reviews the relevant pipeline & config in the M365 admin center to confirm the expected changes have been successfully applied

#### Build and Validation
1. Build Pipeline (build.yaml):
	* Compiles MOF files from tenant configuration data.
	* Copies necessary scripts and resources to the output directory.

2. Pull Request Validation (prvalidation.yaml):
	* Validates configuration changes in pull requests.
	* Ensures compliance with naming and encoding standards.

#### Deployment
1. Dependency Management (dependencies.yaml):
	* Retrieves secrets from Azure Key Vault.
	* Prepares dependencies for deployment.

2. Deployment Pipeline (deployment.yaml):
	* Deploys configurations to Microsoft 365 tenants.
	* Executes orchestration logic from the Infrastructure repository.

#### Compliance Testing
1. Compliance Testing Pipeline (testcompliancy.yaml):
	* Tests tenant compliance with desired configurations.
	* Generates HTML compliance reports.

2. Export Pipeline (export.yaml):
	* Deploys configurations to Microsoft 365 tenants.
	* Exports tenant configurations for auditing and traceability.

### What should be managed in Microsoft 365 DSC?

The intended scope of management in Microsoft 365 DSC should focus on persistent, core configuration settings that are crucial for maintaining the desired state and security posture of the tenants. This includes global settings such as isSingleInstance = $true, as well as workload settings such as conditional access policies, MPIP labels & EXO organisation config.

Microsoft 365 DSC is not intended for managing disposable or high volume configurations, such as user management or business driven security groups, which are more transient and subject to frequent changes. By concentrating on stable, foundational settings, Microsoft 365 DSC ensures a consistent and secure configuration baseline across the organisation.

## Managing Configuration

The following section details how the workload configuration is set between the various data files within the Configuration repository.

### Data Files

A data file in PowerShell Desired State Configuration is a structured file that contains configuration data, such as node-specific settings and environment variables, which are used to customise and manage the desired state of target nodes (in this instance, tenants)

When reviewing the Configuration repository, you will see a folder called `datafiles`. This folder contains two child folders, one named `Tenants` and another called `templates`

The `Tenants` folder contains all of the tenant specific configuration files, the `templates` folder contains all of the global configuration files that are to be applied to all tenants under the management of Microsoft 365 DSC.

### Global Settings

#### Global

The global layer data files define the workload settings that will be applied to all tenants that are under the management of Microsoft 365 DSC as the base configuration.

Location: Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration\DataFiles\Templates\Global\Global*.psd1

#### Enforced

The enforced data files define settings that are enforced for all tenants. Settings in this file must be present in the global files with the same values and cannot be specified in any of the tenants specific files.

These settings are validated using a to a unit test approach during the build pipeline, this is first validated against the global layer, requiring all settings that are present in the enforced data files to be configured exactly as specified in the related Global datafiles. If this test is successful a second unit test is carried out against the tenant layer checking that none of the settings are present within tenant specific files, preventing all settings in the Enforced layer from being overridden with different values.

Location: Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration\DataFiles\Templates\Enforced\Enforced*.psd1

### Tenant Specific Settings

#### Tenant

These are the settings that are tenant specific. Either because the workload setting is specific to only that tenant so cannot be present in the global configuration, or because you want to override a setting from the Global layer (SettingX = 1 in Global, but for this tenant it should be SettingX = 2)

Location: Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration\DataFiles\Tenants\<Tenant>\<TenantName><WorkloadName>.psd1

### Example Configuration 

The following section is intended to visualise how settings would be applied to DEV, NLE & PROD based on how various workload settings were configured within different data files.

In this example, the `Global` configuration contains the following settings:

```powershell
@{
	NonNodeData = @{
		Teams = @{
			ChannelsPolicies = @(
				@{
					AllowOrgWideTeamCreation = $false
                    AllowChannelSharingToExternalUser  = $true
				}
			)
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `Enforced` configuration contains the following settings:

```powershell
@{
	NonNodeData = @{
		Teams = @{
			ChannelsPolicies = @(
				@{
                    AllowChannelSharingToExternalUser  = $true
				}
			)
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `DEV` tenant specific configuration contains the following settings:

```powershell
@{
	NonNodeData = @{
		Teams = @{
			ChannelsPolicies = @(
				@{
					AllowOrgWideTeamCreation = $true
				}
			)
		}
		AzureAD = @{
			TenantDetails = @(
				@{
					TenantId = DEV
				}
			)
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `NLE` tenant specific configuration contains the following settings:

```powershell
@{
	NonNodeData = @{
		Teams = @{
			ChannelsPolicies = @(
				@{
					AllowOrgWideTeamCreation = $true
				}
			)
		}
		AzureAD = @{
			TenantDetails = @(
				@{
					TenantId = NLE
				}
			)
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `PROD` tenant specific configuration contains the following settings:

```powershell
@{
	NonNodeData = @{
		AzureAD = @{
			TenantDetails = @(
				@{
					TenantId = PROD
				}
			)
		}
	}
}
```

When the build pipeline runs, it will read and merge the various datafiles contained within the Configuration repository using the logic displayed within the diagram shown below, resulting in applied settings within each tenants MOF file shown at the bottom of the flow.

</pre>


### Understanding Available Properties 

To understand the available properties and settings for a given version of Microsoft365DSC, you can use the M365DSC.CompositeResources module. This module provides a complete reference of all resources and settings.

To export an example data file to a location of your choice, follow these steps:
1. Install the M365DSC.CompositeResources module:
	```powershell

	   Install-Module -Name M365DSC.CompositeResources -Force

	```
2. Run the following command to generate an example data file:
	```powershell

	   New-M365DSCExampleDataFile -OutputPath "C:\Path\To\Output"

	```
This will create a sample configuration file with all available properties.

For more details, refer to the [New-M365DSCExampleDataFile documentation](https://github.com/ykuijs/M365DSC.CompositeResources/blob/main/source/Public/New-M365DSCExampleDataFile.ps1)



### Exporting Existing Configurations 

You can export the existing configuration from a tenant using the Export Pipeline. This pipeline produces an artifact containing both the raw DSC output and the composite module (where available) for the workloads defined in the tenants generic file. 

* Pipeline: Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration\Pipelines\export.yaml
* Script: Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Infrastructure\Scripts\Export.ps1


## Governance

This page provides a comprehensive guide to managing code ownership, branch protection, and file authoring workflows in the Microsoft365DSC repositories. It explains how to configure the CODEOWNERS file, enforce branch protection rules, and establish workflows for workload and platform administrators.

### Code Ownership with CODEOWNERS

The CODEOWNERS file in GitHub is used to assign responsibility for specific files or directories to teams. This ensures that the appropriate teams are automatically requested as reviewers for pull requests (PRs) affecting their areas of responsibility.

#### Example CODEOWNERS File

```plaintext
# Platform Admins Team
# Responsible for managing core files such as generic files and pipelines
**/*#Generic.psd1 @ministryofjustice/eucs-automation-platform-admins
Pipelines/* @ministryofjustice/eucs-automation-platform-admins

# Modern Workplace Admins Team
# Responsible for managing workload-specific configurations across tenant, global, and enforced layers
DataFiles/Templates/Global/* @ministryofjustice/eucs-modern-workplace-admins
DataFiles/Templates/Enforced/* @ministryofjustice/eucs-modern-workplace-admins
DataFiles/Tenants/* @ministryofjustice/eucs-modern-workplace-admins

# Default ownership for all other files
* @ministryofjustice/eucs-automation-platform-admins
```

#### Key Points
The platform admin team are assigned ownership of:
		* All generic.psd1 files  
		* All pipeline files
This ensures that platform administrators manage the core files and CI/CD pipelines.

The workload product team e.g. Modern Workplace Admins Team are assigned ownership of:
		* Global settings: DataFiles/Templates/Global/*
		* Enforced settings: DataFiles/Templates/Enforced/*
		* Tenant-specific settings: DataFiles/Tenants/*
This ensures that workload administrators manage configurations for their respective workloads across all layers.

All other files are assigned to the eucs-automation-platform-admins team by default: *. 


### Branch Protection Rules
Branch protection rules enforce policies on protected branches (e.g., main, develop) to ensure that changes are reviewed, validated, and approved before merging.

The branch protection policies are configured as below:
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXX

### File Authoring Workflows
1. Create a Feature Branch: Workload admins create a feature branch (e.g., feature/<workload-change>) to make changes to their workload-specific data files.
2. Make Changes:Update the relevant files in their workload (e.g., OneDrive.psd1 or Exchange.psd1).
3. Submit a Pull Request: Submit a PR to merge the feature branch into the main or develop branch.
4. Review and Approval: The CODEOWNERS file ensures that the relevant product teams admin GitHub team members are automatically requested as reviewers for changes to workload-specific files.
5. Merge: Once the PR is approved and all CI/CD checks pass, the workload admins can merge the changes into the protected branch.

### Summary
Workload Admins:
* Contribute to workload-specific files (e.g., DataFiles/Templates/Global/*, DataFiles/Templates/Enforced/*, DataFiles/Tenants/*).
* Must use the feature branch and PR workflow.
* Cannot directly push to protected branches.

Platform Admins:
* Contribute to core files (e.g., **/*#Generic.psd1, Pipelines/*).
* Use the feature branch and PR workflow for regular changes.
* Have direct push access to protected branches for hotfixes or emergencies.

Branch Protection Rules:
* Enforce PR-based workflows for all changes.
* Require reviews from code owners and passing CI/CD checks.

## Onboarding a new tenant

This section provides a detailed guide for onboarding a new tenant to the Microsoft365DSC automation solution. The onboarding process involves creating the necessary app registrations, configuring permissions, provisioning data files, and running the dependencies pipeline.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before onboarding a new tenant, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Access to the Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration repository.
2. Permissions in Microsoft Entra to create app registrations and assign roles in the new tenant.
3. PowerShell 5.1 or later & VS Code installed on your local machine.
4. Clone the `Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration` Repository to your device within VS Code
5. Create a feature branch in the Configuration repository using the naming convention: feature/<Identifier> Example: feature/TenantXYZ-onboarding

> NOTE: Remember to check the Global and Enforced configurations that are already set prior to onboarding a new environment, if any of these settings are not appropriate for the new target tenant then these workload settings should be moved back to the tenant specific data files prior to onboarding the new tenant.

### 2. Create App Registration
#### 2.1 Create a certificate
1. Generate a new authentication certificate that will be used by the app registration using the following script:
```powershell

$clientCert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=Microsoft365DSC" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\LocalMachine\My" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature

$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "<password>" -AsPlainText -Force

Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $clientCert -FilePath C:\<TenantShortName>M365ClientCert.pfx -Password $password

Export-Certificate -Cert $clientCert -FilePath C:\<TenantShortName>M365ClientCert.cer

$clientCert.Thumbprint

```
2. Take note of the Certificate Thumbprint and PFX Password for later use.

> NOTE: Update the Password and TenantShortName to relevant values

#### 2.2 Create an App Registration and Configure Permissions
1. Download [this](https://github.com/ykuijs/M365DSC_CICD/blob/main/Supportscripts/CreateServicePrincipals.psm1) script to your machine
2. Load the downloaded module into your PowerShell session to support programmatic creation of the service principal:
```powershell
	Import-Module <Script_Path>\CreateServicePrincipals.psm1	
```
3. Create the app registration and grant the correct permissions by running the following PowerShell commands:
```powershell
	$DSCAppName = "MoJO-<TenantShortName>-M365DSC-ConfigurationDeployment"
	$tempPath = "$($env:USERPROFILE)\Downloads"
	New-M365DSCServicePrincipal -Credential (Get-Credential) -ServicePrincipalName 
	$DSCAppName -CertificatePath <TenantShortName>M365ClientCert.cer
```
4. At the end of the script, the output shows details of the created app, take note of these details. These are required in further steps.

> NOTE: Update the TenantShortName to a relevant value
> NOTE: The script allows for creation of service principals for a specific workload. If you use the Workload parameter, the script will only grant the required permissions for that workload.
> NOTE: To see which permissions are required for which resource, use the [Get-M365CompiledPermissionList](https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/cmdlets/Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList/) cmdlet or review the documentation of each resource in the Resources section on [Microsoft365DSC.com](https://microsoft365dsc.com)


#### 2.3 Grant Admin Consent 
1. Grant Admin Consent for the assigned API permissions in Entra ID.

### 3. Provision Data Files
#### 3.1 Run the provisioning script
1. Navigate to the Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration\DataFiles\Templates directory.
2. Execute the ProvisionNewEnvironment.ps1 script to generate the required data files for the new tenant:
```powershell
	.\ProvisionNewEnvironment.ps1 -EnvironmentName "Tenant_ShortName"
```
> NOTE: Update the Tenant_ShortName with the short name of the tenant e.g. MoJoDEV

#### 3.2 Update the Generic.psd1 file
1. Locate the newly created Generic.psd1 file in the DataFiles\Tenants directory.
2. Update the following sections in the file:
		* Used Workloads: Specify which workloads (e.g., Exchange, Teams, SharePoint) are used by the tenant.
		* Tokens Section: Leave placeholders as they are but ensure the tokens section is updated with the correct values.
		* App Credentials: Add the App ID and Certificate Thumbprint for each workload.

> NOTE: Reference the existing tenants Generic.psd1 files if needed as an example 

#### 3.4 Add the Certificate 
1. Place the .pfx certificate file in the same directory as the Generic.psd1 file.
2. Ensure the certificate file follows the naming convention: `Tenant_ShortNameM365ClientCert.pfx`

### 4. Commit Changes 
1. Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration repository.
2. Stage the changes:
		* Add the updated Generic.psd1 file and the .pfx certificate file.
3. Commit the changes to the feature branch, Use a meaningful commit message, such as "Onboarded new tenant: Tenant_ShortName"
4. Sync the changes to the remote feature branch

### 5. Run the Dependencies Pipeline
1. Navigate to the Azure DevOps portal and locate the dependencies.yaml pipeline in the Staff-Infrastructure-Microsoft365-DSC-Configuration repository.
2. Add the following Environments parameter array to the pipeline:
		`Environments:
 		 - Name: "Tenant_ShortName"
    	   CertificatePassword: "$(Tenant_ShortNameCertPassword)"`
		   * Replace Tenant_ShortName with the tenants short name.
		   * Add the certificate password as a secret pipeline variable in Azure DevOps.
3. Trigger the pipeline and monitor its execution to ensure all dependencies are successfully configured.

### 6. Validation 
#### 6.1 Build Validation
1. Manually run the build.yaml pipeline in the feature branch to ensure it completes successfully.
#### 6.2 Pull Request Process
1. Create a pull request (PR) from the feature branch to the develop branch.
2. Once the PR is approved and merged, create another PR from develop to main.
3. The PR into main will trigger the PR validation pipeline.

#### 6.3 CICD Triggers 
1. Once the changes are merged into main, the following pipelines will be triggered automatically
	* build.yaml
	* deployment.yaml
	* testcompliancy.yaml


## Compliancy Checks 

This solution runs the Check Compliancy pipeline twice daily, once at 08:00 and once at 18:00 daily. When this pipeline runs it checks the configuration of each tenant that are under management of Microsoft 365 DSC against the data files that are specified in the configuration repositories to make sure all workload settings that are defined within DSC are compliant. At current maturity this solution does not enforce automatic remediation actions if DSC notices a configuration drift within the tenant, the results of these checks are sent to XXXXXXXXX for administrators to observe. 

By continuously monitoring the environment, MoJ ensure that the tenants are in their intended state before the start of, and at the end of, the organisations core working hours reducing the risk of misconfigurations that may impact the end user experience or security posture.

## Breaking Changes

### What are breaking changes?

Microsoft 365 is under constant development, which means that functionalities are being added, deprecated or removed all the time. Microsoft365DSC has to adapt to these changes and at the same time make sure existing users and configurations are impacted as little as possible.

In the cases where a new resource is added, a resource gets a new optional parameter or a parameter that used to be mandatory becomes optional, existing configurations are not impacted. But when a resource or parameter is removed or an optional parameter becomes mandatory, existing configurations can stop functioning, because they are using these removed components. That is what is called a “Breaking Change”: A change that can break existing configurations and therefore impact the administration process of Microsoft 365.

Twice a year Microsoft release a version that bundles all breaking changes of the previous six months into a single version, these releases occur in April and October annually.

### How we handle the breaking changes release schedule 

The release notes of the breaking changes versions will have all breaking changes clearly documented, including the required actions to take, which are almost certain to be required.

MoJ will lag the release of the breaking changes release by 8 weeks, to give a chance for the community to identify any issues or bugs with the latest release before carrying out a version uplift to the estate.

The version of Microsoft 365 DSC this solution is deployed with is managed by the application platform team as primary owners of the CICD configuration. Application platform will lead on the discovery and release of the breaking changes release to ensure that all product teams who manage their workloads via Microsoft 365 DSC are working together to evaluate the release and identify what changes are required to our configuration.
